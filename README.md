# Grain-variogram-calculation
This Python 3 code attempts to examine if there are spatial correlations between the different spherical grains in a bidisperse (two-sized) grain pack by constructing variograms for measuring the spatial distribution of grain volumes and the inter-granular distances


Investigation of correlated spatial heterogeneity is important for reservoir characterization in the
petroleum industry. The inputs for the code are the co-ordinates of all the spherical grains, their
diameters (refer .csv file) and the length of grain pack, and the output is a variogram.
